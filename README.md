## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Media queries I really struggled with them since a long time and after this project I am getting comfortable with it. In this project I used grid from bootstrap, though it did not come up how I wanted it to be, but I will make sure to continue learn different things.

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning how to make your design more responsive and some CSS properties such as display, position, z-index, and a lot more.

### Useful resources

- https://fontawesome.com/ - I took icons and customized in my own way for the project.
- https://www.w3schools.com/ - I cannot stop talking the advantages of this site, you can learn web development from 0 to next level. I would recommend this to clear out your basics.
